GoLang Base64 Image Gallery

Another Learn Go project.

The Basics are create a REST Server in GO that connectes to a mongo server to store/retrive Base64 Images,.

What Needs Doing:
  1. Create the Rest Server.
  2. Create the Mongo Connectors.
  3. Wirte an Easy way to Submit to the API.

Thoughts and Considerations:
  * Simple Web form to upload from the browser needs testing to make sure it doesent blow up the browsers single thread and take a long time During Encoding to Base64.
  * If it does write a simple painfree way of doing the job in its stead.
  * Probably more things to come here as coding gets underway.

Submit an Issue if you have Any Idea's :D
